Awesome! You're at the perfect stage to start polishing and expanding the Marine Knowledge AI prototype into a truly impressive tool. Here's what we can work on next, broken down into optional improvements and major upgrades:

---

### ✅ Core Functionality Enhancements

1. **Highlight Matching Text (Frontend)**

   * Extract a short snippet from the document text that most closely matches the query using `difflib` or embedding-based similarity.
   * Show this snippet under the title for more relevant preview.

2. **Open Full Document (PDF Viewer)**

   * Add a **"View PDF"** button that links to the actual PDF in a new tab.
   * Example: `href="data/raw_documents/filename.pdf"`.

3. **Better Scores (Similarity Metrics)**

   * Right now, you show `score = 1 - distance` from Chroma. You can normalize or threshold these to hide low-confidence results or show a "relevance meter".

---

### 🎨 UI & UX Improvements

1. **Responsive Design**

   * Make the UI mobile/tablet-friendly using Bootstrap or simple media queries.

2. **Search Suggestions (Auto-complete)**

   * Add an optional suggestion box for common queries (e.g., "compressor", "valve", "manual").

3. **Result Sorting or Filtering**

   * Allow sorting by confidence score, file name, or type (if you included metadata like 'document\_type').

---

### 📈 Advanced Features

1. **Chunk-Level Embeddings**

   * Instead of embedding entire documents, split into chunks (e.g., per paragraph or 500 words) and embed each one.
   * Return specific chunks that match the query (much more accurate search!).

2. **Feedback Loop (Optional Later)**

   * Add thumbs-up/thumbs-down on results and log them to a file for future model improvement or training.

---

### 🛠️ Next Step (My Suggestion)

Let’s start by improving the **frontend**:

* Add “View PDF” button
* Improve how results are displayed
* Highlight matched terms in the preview

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect! Now that the core prototype is working, here’s how we’ll proceed with the enhancement plan in structured steps:

---

### ✅ Completed So Far:

* PDF metadata & text ingestion
* Sentence-transformer embeddings (768-dim with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* Indexed to ChromaDB
* Flask API serving semantic search
* Simple UI (`index.html`) for querying and viewing results

---

### 🔧 Phase 2: Improvements & Enhancements

#### 📌 Part 1: Frontend Enhancements (UI/UX)

1. **✅ Add PDF links**

   * Let users open the actual document (anchor `<a>` tag pointing to local or hosted PDF).
2. **✅ Display full document title, score, and file name cleanly**
3. **🔍 Highlight matching keywords in preview text**

   * We'll wrap matches with `<mark>` in the result.
4. **📁 Optional: Search Filters**

   * Filter by `document_type` or `score` threshold
5. **🎨 UI Beautification**

   * Basic CSS with responsive styling (bootstrap or custom)
   * “Loading…” indicator while fetching results

#### 🧠 Part 2: Improved Search Relevance

1. **🧩 Chunk-based Embeddings (Phase 2.1)**

   * Instead of encoding full doc text, split into smaller chunks (e.g., 200–300 words each)
   * Store each chunk with metadata like `chunk_id`, `page_num` (if available), etc.
   * This will allow more precise search (users don’t care about the *whole* doc—just the relevant section)

2. **📌 Search API Changes**

   * Update `/search` endpoint to return chunk-level hits (not full document-level only)
   * Include pagination or “see full doc” links

#### 🧪 Part 3: Add Optional Search Features

* Keyword-based fallback if embedding fails
* Sort by score, title, etc.
* Export search results (JSON, CSV)

### ✅ Next Step

Let’s start with:
**🧩 Phase 2.1: Chunk-based Embedding Ingestion**

I’ll now rewrite `generate_embeddings.py` to:

* Split long texts into smaller overlapping chunks
* Embed each chunk separately
* Store them in a new file: `embedded_chunks.json`
